    "This Python program is designed to **automate the initial eligibility screening** for driving license applications at **ABC Driving School**. The system prompts users to input their:\n",

    "- Full name (as per official ID)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age\n",
    "\n",
    "- Desired class of driving license (e.g., 2B, 2A, 3, 4, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It then performs the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validates if the user meets the **minimum legal age requirement** for the selected license class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requests an **8-digit contact number** if the applicant is eligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confirms that a customer service officer will follow up within three working days.\n",

    "By automating these checks, the program helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduce manual workload** for customer service staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prevent** unnecessary processing of **ineligible applications**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure that all required **information is captured accurately and efficiently** before further steps."
